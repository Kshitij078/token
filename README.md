Creating Tokens with Solidity
This repository provides easy-to-use ERC20 tokens using Solidity, a static, contract-oriented high-level library for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
Solidity is a symbolic bracketing programming language designed to create smart contracts running on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Smart contracts are services that run on a peer-to-peer network and no one has special permissions, allowing anyone to use, own, vote, and more with valuable tokens.

contract MyToken {
    string public tokenName = "Fujjyu";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "FJY";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}

You can use Remix, a browser-based Solidity IDE, to distribute tokens. The steps are as follows:
Clone the repository: Copy this repository to your local computer. Use the contract. application.
Solidity is a curly brace programming language designed to create smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
Smart contracts are services that run on a peer-to-peer network and no one has special permissions, thus allowing anyone to use, own, vote, and otherwise manipulate valuable tokens.
